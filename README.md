Project Description:
During my internship at CodTech IT Private Limited, I worked on a Real-Time Chat Application, a full-stack web application designed for instant messaging and communication between multiple users. The project enables users to send and receive messages in real-time, with updates immediately visible to all connected participants.

The frontend was developed using React.js, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface. The backend used Node.js with Express and Socket.IO to handle real-time communication between clients. MongoDB was used for persistent storage of chat messages, allowing users to maintain chat history across sessions.

The application emphasizes real-time messaging, database integration, and full-stack development practices. Users can send, receive, and view messages instantly while the backend manages broadcasting messages to all connected clients and storing chat history.

This internship helped me enhance my skills in React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, and WebSocket-based real-time applications, while gaining hands-on experience in building interactive, data-driven full-stack applications. The project also demonstrates the ability to work under guidance, follow best coding practices, and deliver a functional solution within the one-month internship duration.
